## Time spent

### Setup

- 15m on reading and understanding the task
- 15m on build setup: opted to learn raw vite setup rather than already known create-react-app
- 15m to consider inclusion of server side rendering for the project, decided to not overkill it
- 30m to [experiment](https://github.com/magicwrites/trip-emissions/tree/api-mock) and eventually rely on [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io) instead of [vercel functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions)
